# My_Youtube_Comment_Scraper
This program will take a URL for a youtube video and take the first ~20 comments (text only) and write them to a file without the YouTube API (using Selenium Webdriver and Firefox).

This program is very simple since it only acquires comments (no users, no likes, no replies, etc). Of course there are better comments scrapers out there, this project is just to show my programming abilities.

This program is adapted from a group class project with my contributions only (other parts were removed such as YouTube API requests and a custom web crawler).

REQUIREMENTS (windows only)
1. Python 3 or above
2. Selenium Webdriver for Python (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)
3. Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
4. Geckodriver for Firefox (placed in same directory as Scraper.py) (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
