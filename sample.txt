OUTPUT (shown in video showcase):
	But are you playing on the Souljagame console?
	1:33 Oh my gosh Dunkey you were right  It's Tony Tiger from cereal
	You can buy the ultimate version of super smash bros ultimate for 99.99$
	This reminds me of that time Dunkey forgot to beat Sky in Smash.
	Nintendo did some bad spaghetti and meatballs
	Dunkey leaked his Credit card info, time to use that to buy multiple copies of Knack.
	Dunkey, you werent using the Donkey Kong Bongo Controller for Donkey Kong.
	The amount of credit card info he showed gave me anxiety
	Now I want Dunkey to voice King Dedede if Kirby ever gets another animated show
	Have a rematch with sky if you arent scared of losing your title.
	Great video Dunkey, but I still don’t understand why you couldn’t stop saying the N word every time Donkey Kong was on screen, that was kinda weird
	Super Smash Bros Ultimate really makes you feel like Knack.
	This game has a lot of characters, but are there custom characters? No. You know what did have custom characters? Lego Star Wars II. AND it had a Gonk Droid. We all know which is a superior title.
	Damn Sky totally annihilated him this time.
	but why did they remove Jimmy Neutron?
	My favorite character is also Donkeyyou'llnoticethatheandotherfightershaveexpressivenewfacialanimations Kong.
	4:33 man you just buy skirym again
	dunkey's comment section is a r/wooosh minefield. beware new viewers
	Dunkey leaked his credit card info so that he can help Ninja get that epic victory royale.
